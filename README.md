Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: It is recommended to use the LTS version.

Angular CLI: Install it globally using npm:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Cloning the Repository
If you have Git installed, the easiest way to get the project is to clone the repository:

git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
cd [Your Project Folder Name]

Replace [Your Repository URL Here] with the actual URL of your Git repository (e.g., from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Replace [Your Project Folder Name] with the name of the folder created by the clone command (usually the repository name).

Alternatively, if you downloaded a ZIP file:

Locate the downloaded .zip file.

Right-click the .zip file and select "Extract All..." (Windows) or double-click (macOS/Linux) to extract its contents to a folder.

Navigate into the extracted project folder using your terminal/command prompt.

Installing Dependencies
Once you are in the project directory (where package.json is located), install all the necessary Node modules:

npm install

This command reads the package.json file and downloads all the required libraries and dependencies into the node_modules folder.

Running the Development Server
After installing dependencies, you can start the development server:

ng serve

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
